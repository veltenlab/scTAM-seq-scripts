# A collection of scripts for analyzing data obtained from single-cell Targeted Analysis of the Methylome (scTAM-seq)

## Overview
The folder structure currently contains subfolders for the different contributors for the projects, i.e., there is the folder [mscherer](mscherer) for all scripts created by Michael. This currently contains the following:

### [Hui2018](mscherer/Hui2018)
Some scripts to explore the single-cell DNA methylation data generated in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.07.003

### [autoencoder](mscherer/autoencoder)
The scripts for running the autoencoder can be found in [autoencoder](mscherer/autoencoder) and the extension of the DCA python package can be found in the repository [dca](https://github.com/veltenlab/dca).

### [doublet_detection](mscherer/doublet_detection)
In this folder, we explored different doublet detection stategies, including the following methods:
- [DoubletDetection](https://github.com/JonathanShor/DoubletDetection)
- [Scrublet](https://github.com/swolock/scrublet): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218304745?via%3Dihub
- [doubletCells](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scran.html): https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2122/v2
- [doubletFinder](https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder)
- [Solo](https://github.com/calico/solo): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471220301952

We integrated DoubletDetection into out default workflow, since it showed superior performance on our data.

### [doublet_estimation](mscherer/doublet_estimation)
Here, we explored different properties of the data to hypothesize whether another method for doublet detection might be superior to already existing solutions. This was not the case.

### [manuscript](mscherer/manuscript)
The collection of R scripts needed to re-generate the plots that we already generated for the manuscript. The scripts are ordered by the Figure/panel they are needed for.

### [plotting](mscherer/plotting)
A collection of R scripts to both analyze and visualize raw data generated by scTAM-seq and also for visualizing the output of the methylation autoencoder.

### [tapestri](mscherer/tapestri)
This contains the re-implementation of the Mission Bio tapestri pipeline to generate all of the files needed for downstream processing.
