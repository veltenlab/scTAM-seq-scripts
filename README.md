# A collection of scripts for analyzing data obtained from single-cell Targeted Analysis of the Methylome (scTAM-seq)

## Overview
The folder structure currently contains subfolders for the different contributors for the projects, i.e., there is the folder [mscherer](mscherer) for all scripts created by Michael. This currently contains the following:

### [plotting](mscherer/plotting)
A collection of R scripts to both analyze and visualize raw data generated by scTAM-seq and also for visualizing the output of the methylation autoencoder.

### [autoencoder](mscherer/autoencoder)
The scripts for running the autoencoder can be found in [autoencoder](mscherer/autoencoder) and the extension of the DCA python package can be found in the repository [dca](https://github.com/veltenlab/dca).
