# Installation
We use the downloaded version of the Mission Bio Tapestri platform (v2), which we downloaded from here:

```
wget https://dl.missionbio.io/onprem-miniconda/TapestriPipeline-v2.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

And install the pipeline using the installation script. You will have to add some parts of the path, where the program has been installed to specific steps of the bash pipelines (variable $TAPESTRI).
